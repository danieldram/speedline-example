# COMMENTS
Originally provided function examples given are labeled as 'print-winner-1' & 'print-winner-2', unit tests for each function can be found in the 'speedline.test.js' file. To run those tests, simply remove .skip from the test functions and run 'npm test'

Proposed solution can be found in the 'lib' folder with tests for each function and the final composition solution can also be found in the 'speedline.test.js' file.
